    <h2>Phoebe Kuhn</h2>
    <p><em>Communication and Content Specialist</em></p><br>

    <h4>Jake is one of those rare and special people that truly “gets it”. I’ve never worked with anyone that has such a profound, intimate and full rounded knowledge of the mind-body connection.</h4><br><br>
    <p>I have spent over three years studying human behaviour, the quantum field and Psychosomatics with some of the best teachers and coaches in the world but I was only able to get so far. It has only been since working with Jake that I feel I now
      have the real answers that lie underneath ANY physiological symptoms. </p>
    <p> I’ve had three 1:1 sessions with Jake and every single one of them was more profound and awe inspiring than the last. I was highly allergic to cats since I was a child. Every time a cat would come near me my eyes and face would swell up, turn
      red and itch for several days afterward.</p>
    <p> Having recently moved to Bali, I was surrounded by stray animals and became concerned about my allergies. In just fifteen minutes using GNM Jake completely alleviated me of my allergy. I have since lived in a house with TWO cats and am completely symptom free!</p>
    <p>The second time I called him was to discuss a sharp pain in my left shoulder. I initially thought it was from tearing a muscle during a workout but my personal trainer confirmed that we didn’t train my shoulder that day so I KNEW it had to be what Jake taught me was the symptom of an “emotional conflict”.</p>

    <details>

      <summary style='font-size: 1.2rem; font-family:open sans;'>READ MORE</summary><br>
      <p> The pain was an excruciating 9/10. In the 24 hours prior to our call I had tried two different remedial therapists and nothing helped. Within fifteen minutes of speaking to Jake, the pain had lessened to a 2/10! The emotional/mental reasons behind the pain also made so much sense and just having the awareness of the conflict not only helped to speed up the healing process but also helped me to forgive myself for a lot of guilt I was feeling around personal decisions I had made in my relationships.</p>
      <p>The night after our call I was able to rest easy, both in my body and also having clarity and peace in my mind. </p>
      <p>Our last call was the most interesting one of all. He encouraged me to rewrite a story I was telling myself about a breakup that was causing me insomnia and a lack of focus in my business for about two weeks. That evening I had one of the most heart opening experiences I had in a long time. Through looking at the breakup in a completely new light, I broke THROUGH the discomfort and pain I was feeling in my heart and moved to a place of deep appreciation for both that person and myself. I saw how everything had to happen exactly the way that it did, so that I could move to the next phase of my life with grace. That everything really was happening FOR me and not to me. That there was a deeper meaning behind these events. </p>
      <p>Since that day I have been feeling nothing but grateful for who I am and where I’m going. Working with Jake and GNM has been one of the most transformational experiences of my life. Thank you so much Jake. </p>

    <h2>Carolina Araya Zavala </h2>
    <p><em>Self Love and Relationship Coach</em></p><br>
    <p>Over the last 6 months I’ve been working with Jake and every session has been absolutely life changing. Being a life coach myself I’m pretty familiar with a myriad of techniques and methodologies to identify & overcome limiting beliefs and the
      way they show up in the physical body but have never experienced this depth of accuracy in diagnose and immediate transformation as Jake supported me to achieve.</p>
    <p>The first time we had a session I managed to get rid of chronic pain on my shoulder that I’ve experienced for over 3 years. The pain would come and go and it was limiting my quality of life. 15’ into the session the pain was almost gone and
      even better: I got a clear understanding of where it was coming from which in turn caused a profound transformation on the way I was addressing a specific challenge in my intimate relationships.</p>
    <p>I’d totally recommend you to work with Jake. I literally call him the wizard and I recommend it to all my friends who have also seen outstanding results.</p>
