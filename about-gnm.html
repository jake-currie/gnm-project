    <h2> How does German New Medicine work? </h2>
  </div>
  <div class='col-8_sm-12-middle'>
    <p> In order to understand GNM, you need to leave behind everything you have been taught about medicine and 'health'. <br><br><strong>Are you ready?</strong><br><br>Modern medicine is constantly 'fighting disease' in an epic healthcare battle. Each year our health care system spends literally <strong>TRILLIONS</strong> of dollars creating various medications to kill off certain bugs and viruses.<br><br> German new medicine understands that the body never makes mistakes, there is no 'disease' only intelligent adaptations made by the body in response to stress.  </p>

<!-- THE FIVE BIOLOGICAL LAWS OF NATURE -->

    <h2>The five biological laws of nature</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-12_sm-12 center">
    <p>German New Medicine was founded by Dr. med. Ryke Geerd Hamer, it is a revolutionary discovery that shows the remarkable healing capabilities of the human body. Dr. Hamer discoveries are based on the Five Biological Laws of Nautre. The following is taken directly from the <a href="">Learning GNM Website </a> </p>

    <div class="grid padded">
    <h2 class='col-4_sm-12'> First biological law</h2>
    <p class='col-8 left'> Every “disease” - hereinafter called Significant Biological Special Program (SBS) - originates from a DHS (Dirk Hamer Syndrome),  which is an unexpected, highly acute, and isolating conflict shock that occurs simultaneously in the psyche, the brain, and on the corresponding organ.<br> <br>The content of the conflict determines which organ will be affected and from which area of the brain the SBS will be controlled. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid padded">
    <h2 class='col-4_sm-12'> Second biological law</h2>
    <p class='col-8 left'> Every SBS-Significant Biological Special Program runs in two phases provided there is a resolution of the conflict. We have been taugh we are either well or sick. However GNM has a completely different perspective, we are never 'sick' or 'have something wrong with us'. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid padded">
    <h2 class='col-4_sm-12'> Third biological law</h2>
    <p class='col-8 left'> Every “disease” - hereinafter called Significant Biological Special Program (SBS) - originates from a DHS (Dirk Hamer Syndrome),  which is an unexpected, highly acute, and isolating conflict shock that occurs simultaneously in the psyche, the brain, and on the corresponding organ.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid padded">
    <h2 class='col-4_sm-12'> Forth biological law</h2>
    <p class='col-8 left'> Every “disease” - hereinafter called Significant Biological Special Program (SBS) - originates from a DHS (Dirk Hamer Syndrome),  which is an unexpected, highly acute, and isolating conflict shock that occurs simultaneously in the psyche, the brain, and on the corresponding organ.</p>

<!-- THIS CONFLICT, SBS, HEALING  -->
<section class='center light-bg padded'>
  <h2>How does "dis-ease" start? </h2>
  <p>German New Medicine recognises that the body makes no mistakes, only adaptations. Symptoms that have been labeled diseases by modern medicine are smart and meaningful adaptations made by our body designed to help us deal with changes in the environment. This process is based on the 5 biological laws of nature discovered by Dr. Hamer.  </p>

<!-- THIS IS THE HOW GNM WORKS (CONFLICT SHOCK)-->
<section class="grid">
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-1 card-1">
    <div class="card-1 padded-1 ">
    <h2> "The Cause" </h2>
    <h3>Unexpected Conflict Shock</h3>
    <p>A highly acute, unexpected biological conflict shock hits the psyche. These conflicts are completely subjective and act on the subconscious mind. From an evolutionary perspective, these conflicts threaten our survival. </p>
    </div>
  </div>


<!-- THIS IS THE HOW GNM WORKS (SBS)-->
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-1 card-2">
    <div class="card-2 padded-1">
    <h2> "The Adaptation" </h2>
    <h3>Special Biological Programs </h3>
    <p> In response to this conflict shock the brain orchestrates changes at the organ level. These physiological changes known as Special Biological Programs (SBS) are a smart adaptations made by the body to combat the stressful changes in the environment. </p>
    </div>
  </div>


<!-- THIS IS THE HOW GNM WORKS (HEALING)-->
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-1 card-3">
    <div class="card-3 padded-1">

    <h2> "The Healing" </h2>
    <h3> The body returns to homoeostasis </h3>
    <p>Once the biological conflict has resolved, the adaptations made by the body are no longer required. In its return to homoeostasis the body removes the biological adaptations. This process is where most healing crisis symptoms are occurring.
