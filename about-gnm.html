    <h2> How does German New Medicine work? </h2>
  </div>
  <div class='col-8_sm-12-middle'>
    <p> In order to understand GNM, you need to leave behind everything you have been taught about medicine and 'health'. <br><br><strong>Are you ready?</strong><br><br>Modern medicine is constantly 'fighting disease' in an epic healthcare battle. Each year our health care system spends literally <strong>TRILLIONS</strong> of dollars creating various medications to kill off certain bugs and viruses.<br><br> German new medicine understands that the body never makes mistakes, there is no 'disease' only intelliegent adaptations made by the body in response to stress.  </p>

<!-- THIS CONFLICT, SBS, HEALING  -->
<section class='center light-bg padded'>
  <h2>How does "dis-ease" start? </h2>
  <p>German New Medicine recognises that the body makes no mistakes, only adaptations. Symptoms that have been labeled diseases by modern medicine are smart and meaningful adaptations made by our body designed to help us deal with changes in the environment. </p>

<!-- THIS IS THE HOW GNM WORKS (CONFLICT SHOCK)-->

    <h2> "The Cause" </h2>
    <h3>Unexpected Conflict Shock</h3>
    <p>A highly acute, unexpected biological conflict shock hits the psyche. These conflicts are completely subjective and act on the subconscious mind. From an evolutionary perspective, these conflicts threaten our survival. </p>

  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-1 card-2">
    <div class="card-2 padded-1">
    <h2> "The Adaptation" </h2>
    <h3>Special Biological Programs </h3>
    <p> In response to this conflict shock the brain orchestrates changes at the organ level. These physiological changes known as Special Biological Programs (SBS) are a smart adaptations made by the body to combat the stressful changes in the environemnt. </p>

    <div class="card-3 padded-1">

    <h2> "The Healing" </h2>
    <h3> The body returns to homoestatsis </h3>
    <p>Once the biological conflict has resolved, the adaptations made by the body are no longer required. In its return to homoestatis the body removes the biological adaptations. This process is where most healing crisis symptoms are occuring.
