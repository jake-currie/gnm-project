  <h2 data-aos="fade-right"><strong>WHAT IS GNM?</strong></h2><br>
  <p>GNM or German New Medicine, is a revolutionary science that looks at how specific biological conflicts cause 'disease' in the body. </p><br><br>
  <p>The best place to start learning about this amazing work is through the learning GNM website and looking at the 5 biological laws of nature. Which you can find here:</p>
  <a href="https://learninggnm.com/SBS/documents/five_laws.html" target="_blank" class='button1'>Learning GNM Home</a><br><br><br>
  <h3><strong>How was it discovered?</strong></h3>
  <p>Dr Ryke Geerd Hamer MD - was a German Medical Doctor who first discovered the 5 biological laws of nature through his own personal tragady. </p>
  <p>Dr Hamer's son, Dirk, was accidently shot which later led to his death. This was obviously very unexpected and traumatic for Dr Hamer and his wife. </p>

  <p><em>After this unexpected event, Dr Hamer developed a testicular cancer, and his wife developed a breast cancer. </em></p>
  <p>For Dr Hamer this did not make sense, he and his wife led very healthy lives by all means. He postulated that perhaps the unexpected and stressful loss of their son is what caused their cancer to develop.</p>
  <p>He began to question patients suffering with testicular cancer in the clinic he was working, and started to see that others had experienced a similar type of conflict. </p>

  <h4>A basic understanding...</h4>
  <p><em>The first biological law </em></p>
  <p>All disease is simply a smart adaptation made by the body to help the organism cope with a stressful situation. </p>

    <p><em>"German New Medicine (GNM) is the science of how specific unexpected <em>biological conflicts</em> create physical adaptations in the body to help the organism cope with the stressful environment." </em></p><br>
    <p>Sounds complex, right? But it is actually very simple. </p>
    <p>To explain, think of an antelope... </p>
    <p>Let's call him, Anthony. </p>
    <p>Now Anthony the antelope is going for a drink at his usual watering hole, when...BAM!!!</p>
    <p><strong>NO WATER.</strong></p>
    <p>This is an <em>unexpected biological conflict</em> that potentially threatens his existance. </p>
    <p>As a result of this stressful environment, his little antelope kidneys start to adapt.</p><br>
    <h3><em>Modern medicine would call these adaptations a DISEASE.</em></h3><br>
    <p>A GNM practitioner <em>KNOWS</em> this "disease" is actually a smart adaptation by the body to help Anthony conserve water.</p>
    <p><strong>The changes are helping him survive and cope.</strong> </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Your body is no different to Anthony's. </h2><br>
    <br>
    <p> The stressful events that causes these diseases and changes, can be life or death, like Anthony not having any water. </p>
    <p>But more often, your life events are not life or death, <em>but your brain intepretes them as so. </em> </p><br>
    <h4>Some common and simple emotional biological conflicts that cause pain and disease: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Shoulder pain from feeling guitly about missing your kids soccer game </li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Digestive issues from hostile work environment</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Back pain after not getting the raise you were expecting</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> A skin rash that won't shift since a divorce</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Chronic knee pain from feeling slow on the tennis court</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> A flu after Christmas with the inlaws </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Normal human stuff. </h2><br>
    <p>Finding the <em>specific unexpected emotional conflict</em> that is causing your problems, is like putting water back in Anthony's watering hole. </p>
    <p>All of a sudden, your body no longer needs to adapt and create pain and disease. </p>
    <p>It can start healing. <em>INSTANTLY.</em></p>
    <h4><em>German New Medicine is the road map, showing me exactly where your mind and psyche needs to heal.</em> </h4>
