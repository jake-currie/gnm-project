    <h2><strong>Does Jayne's situation sound familiar to you?</strong> </h2><br>
    <p class='smaller1'>"Prior to seeing Jake I had <span class='underline'>constant pelvic pain (since my pregnancy nearly 4 years prior) and neck pain that had been on and off for about 6 months.</span> I regularly saw a Physio for relief (but it would always return) and had massages every 2-4 weeks to manage the pain and discomfort. After my session with Jake, the pain nearly completely disappeared. Over the the next few days it was gone. <strong>It has now been over 2 months and for the first time in years I am no longer dealing with pelvic pain that has always haunted me.</strong>  The thousands of $$ I have spent over the years on Physio and massages are now a thing of the past."</p><br>

<!-- My Story -->

  <div class="col-6_sm-12 " data-aos='fade-right'>
    <h2>I was in constant pain, until I learnt how to <strong>Master my Mind.</strong> </h2><br><br>
    <p><em>As a chiropractor, I tried all kinds of physical therapies and techniques to heal. But nothing ever seemed to work, at least for long.   </em></p><br>
    <h3>I spent my life in search of what was causing my issues. </h3>
    <p>Until, one day I stumbled across the 'roadmap' for the Mind-Body Connection, German New Medicine. </p> <p><em>Within <strong class='underline'>minutes</strong> of shifting a specific old emotional event, a chronic injury that I had for months comlpetely disappeared.</em> </p>
    <p>I realised I had been barking up the wrong tree. Mastering the body was not the key, I needed to <em class='underline'>Master my Mind.</em></p><br><br>
    <p>I dedicated myself to learning and overcoming the unconscious patterns of my Mind-Body that kept me stuck. </p><br>
    <p><em>Using my body as my guide, I was able to clear old unconscious conflicts that were holding me back. I was able to and evolve and grow as a person.</em> </p><br>

    <p>Today, I am a completely different person to who I was back when I was in constant pain. I am now powerful, emotionally resilient, and can shift patterns in my body by doing inner work. </p>
    <p><em>I no longer worry of my body failing, instead I live fearlessly and have complete peace of mind. </em> </p>

      <h1 class="uppercase">Meet Dr Jake Currie</h1>
      <h4>Ba.HSc M.Clin.Chiro - Chiropractor </h4>
      <p class='small'>As a chiropractor, I was naturally drawn to helping people heal. </p>
      <p class='small'>The more I practiced, the more I began to reailse peoples physical pain and problems were not physical at all, but emotionally based. </p>
      <p class='small'><em>The real adversary is poor thinking, and stuck beliefs. I noticed, as soon as people started to think in a more empowered way, they began to truly heal. Not just emotionally, but PHYSICALLY. </em> </p>
      <p class='small'>I started intensly studying German New Medicine (GNM) the work of Dr Hamer 6 years ago. This was a game changer. </p>
      <p class='small'> Finally I had a framework to understand the mind-body connection, and to understand what I had seen in practice. </p>
      <p class='small'><em>I quickly realised that the most important work for healing and growth happened on the inside.</em> </p>
      <p class='small'>I'm still in the world of healing, just in a different way. Instead of removing physical blockages from the body, I am helping people remove blockages from their mind. </p>
      <p class='small'>The work of GNM not only helps people heal and grow, it also helps remove the fear from disease and symptoms. </p>
      <p class='small'>For many, knowing the principals of GNM allows them to feel in control of their own health. </p>
      <p><strong>Today I specialise in physical pain and chronic illnesses, helping people to see a physical shift in the symptoms in literally minutes. </strong> </p>
