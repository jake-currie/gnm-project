    <p><strong> I understand you </strong></p>
    <p>Living with unexplained pain, or symptoms that simply won't go away is what started me on my GNM journey. </p>
    <p> I had grown my practice in Noosa from scratch to capacity within a year, the beauity of this is working with lots of people. More and more I noticed that peoples physical symptoms were not physical at all. I was frusted with why some patients got great results and some patients never seemed to get better, desipite all my best efforts. </p>
    <p> <strong>The day I found GNM Everything changed. </</strong></p>
    <p>I now was able to see the emotional causes of people problems, and help them move through it effortlessly. </p>

<!-- THIS CONFLICT, SBS, HEALING  -->
<section class='center light-bg padded'>
  <h2>How does "dis-ease" start? </h2>
  <p>German New Medicine recognises that the body makes no mistakes, only adaptations. Symptoms that have been labeled diseases by modern medicine are smart and meaningful adaptations made by our body designed to help us deal with changes int he environment. </p>

<section class="grid">
  <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded-1">
    <div class="card">
    <h2> "The Cause" </h2>
    <h3>Unexpected Conflict Shock</h3>
    <p>A highly acute, unexpected biological conflict shock hits the psyche. These conflicts are completely subject and act on the subconscious mind. From an evolutionary perspective, these conflicts threaten our survival. </p>

    <div class="card">


    <h2> "The Adaptation" </h2>
    <h3>Special Biological Programs </h3>
    <p> In response to this conflict shock the brain orchestrates changes at the organ level. These physiological changes known as Special Biological Programs (SBS) are a smart adaptations made by the body to combat the stressful changes in the environemnt. </p>

    <h2> "The Healing Phase" </h2>
    <h3> The body returns to homoestatsis </h3>
    <p>Once the biological conflict has resolved, the adaptations made by the body are no longer required. In its return to homoestatis the body removes the biological adaptations. This process is where most healing criss symptoms are occuring.   </p>

    <h2 class='center'> Step 2 - Break Associations </h2>
    <p> Once you are aware of the mind-body connection creating your issues, it is important to remove any tracks or triggers. </p>
