  <h2 class='padded-1'> About Me </h2>
    <p><strong> I understand you. </strong></p>
    <p>Living with unexplained pain, or symptoms that simply won't go away is what started me on my GNM journey. </p>
    <p> I had grown my Chiropractic practice in Noosa from scratch to capacity within a year, the beauty of that was working with lots of people. More and more I noticed that peoples physical symptoms were not physical at all. I was frustrated with why some patients got great results and some patients never seemed to get better, despite all my best efforts. </p>
    <p> <strong>The day I found GNM everything changed. </strong></p>
    <p>I now was able to see the emotional causes of people problems, and help them move through it effortlessly. </p>

<h2> How can I help you heal? </h2>
<p> Using German New Medicine and the understanding Dr. Hamer created, I will help you make the connection between your mind and body. Through one on one coaching, I can help you resolve both your physical symptoms and the emotional cause.  </p>

    <!-- <h2 class='center'>  Create Awareness</h2> -->
    <p> The first step to resolving physical symptoms and problems is to become aware of the emotional conflicts that created the changes.</p> <p> In our 1-on-1 session I will help you to connect the dots between your physical symptoms and the emotional cause. </p>
    <p>This is the most important stage in taking the fear away from your symptoms and helping you heal naturally. </p>

    <!-- <h2 class='center'> Step 2 - Break Associations </h2> -->
    <p> With any highly acute emotional 'shock' the subconscious mind takes a mental picture of everything you see, hear, taste, feel and smell to protect you from future encounters. </p>
    <p>Each time you step on a track without any awareness you reactivate the special biological program (SBS). You can read more <a href="/about-gnm">here.</a></p>
    <p>Constant reactivation of old conflicts is why people have problems that continue to come back and never truly resolve. </p>

    <!-- <h2 class='center'> Step 3</h2> -->
  <p> Once you understand the link between your mind and body, you have the ability to change how you see the problem.
  </p>
  <p>Biological conflicts are designed to help us overcome 'dangerous' situations. Once we have created awareness we have the ability to change our perspective through re-framing.
