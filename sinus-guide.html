      <h2 class='uppercase'><strong>the mind body connection</strong></h2>
<p class='underline'>Epigenetics is now showing us what ancients have known forever. </p><br>
<h2>Health conditions start first in your mind, then appear in your body. </h2><br><br>
<p>The study of <a href="https:/learninggnm.com" target="_blank">German New Medicine</a> is now bridging the gap between modern science and ancient wisdom. </p><br>
<p>Based on thousands of case studies and brain scans, Dr Ryke Geerd Hamer discovered that most “dis-eases”, pain, skin-issues, allergies, and illness start from <strong>unexpected biological conflicts.</strong> </p><br><br>
<p>The <strong>VERY INSTANT</strong> you experience a biological conflict, or unexpected trauma, it impacts your psyche.</p><br><br>
<h3 class='padded center'> <strong>You feel it emotionally, often feeling distressed, isolated or simply caught off guard.</strong>  </h3>
<p><br>
Then your brain starts a cascade of physical changes in your body to help you cope with the <span class='underline'>stressful situation.</span> </p>
<p>Depending on the type of conflict you experienced determines how your body responds and what symptoms will show up. </p>
<p>Sinus issues show up in <strong>VERY SPECIFIC</strong> areas depending on how conflicts were perceived by you. </p><br><br><br><br>
<h2 class='uppercase'><strong>The real cause of Sinus Issues and colds & flu:</strong></h2><br>
<p>One of the types of biological conflicts that is responsible for creating digestive issues is known as an <strong>‘Stink conflict, or a scent conflict ’</strong>. </p><br><br>
<p>Experiencing an event that literally <strong>‘stinks’</strong> would cause this issue in animals. In humans it is much more figurative. A workplace that one really dislikes, <span class='underline'>‘this situation stinks’</span>.</p><br><br>
<p>Or not being able to <span class='underline'>‘smell a predator coming’</span>. For example, having an unexpected guest stay in your house too long, or having to deal with a challenging co-worker/boss. </p><br><br>
<p>This type of conflict causes the cells of the nasal passage and sinus to ulcerate.</p>
<h3 class='padded center'>The biological purpose of this change is to be able to better <strong>'smell a predator or danger coming'.</strong> </h3> <br>
<h3 class='padded center'>YOUR BODY IS HELPING YOU COPE WITH THE STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT, PROTECTING YOU FROM PERCEIVED DANGER</h3><br><br>
<h2 class='center'>This may sound woo-woo, but German New Medicine is <span class='underline'>science.</span> </h2><br><br>
<p>
It is highly specific, highly accurate, based on thousands of real life case studies and brain scans. GNM is actually now being taught in medical universities in Nicaragua. </p><br><br>
<h2><strong>THE REAL SINUS SYMPTOMS START WHEN THE CONFLICT RESOLVES</strong></h2><br><br>
<p>Once the conflict has resolved, or the percieved danger has passed, there is no need for your body to create ulceration in the nasal passage any longer.  </p><br><br>
<p><strong>You no longer need to be weary of potential danger or predators approaching, so your sinus ulceration can be restored to normal. </strong></p><br><br>
<p class='underline'>Swelling, inflammation, pain and mucus are all a part of the healing phase. </p><br><br>
<p>This is when you experience: </p>
<ul>
  <li class="lists">Blocked nose from all the swelling,</li>
  <li class="lists">Pain in the sinus,</li>
  <li class="lists">Pressure in the sinus and head,</li>
  <li class="lists">Hayfever type symptoms,</li>
  <li class="lists">Runny nose,</li>
  <li class="lists">Allergies, </li>
  <li class="lists">Feeling exhaused and tired, </li>
  <li class="lists">Fever </li>

</ul>
<br><br><br>
<p>
Normally, you will have these symptoms for a few days, maybe longer <em>(depending on how intense the conflict was)</em>. Then, once the body has fully healed, the body will return to balance. No more symptoms!
</p><br><br><p>The symptoms you are experiencing during this time is the body repairing the nasal passage changes it created. </p><br><br>
<p>
After all, you don’t need help ‘smelling unwanted predators’ who might be sneaking up on you. Because they are GONE. </p>
<h2 class='padded center'>Nature does not make mistakes. There is ALWAYS a meaningful purpose to your symptoms. </h2><br><br><br><br>
<h2><strong>But why are my sinus issues chronic, or why do I get constant relapses? </strong></h2><br><br>
<p class='underline'>Because you are unaware of the original conflict that started the sinues issues. </p><br><br>
<p>When you experience something truamatic or unexpected, your subconscious mind will take a snapshot of everything you hear, see, SMELL, taste and touch during this time. </p><br><br>
<h2 class='padded center'>Each time you encounter on of these 'reminders' you will <span class='underline'>UNCONSCIOUSLY be TRIGGERED</span>.  </h2><br><br>
<h3><strong>BOOM! Your symptoms will start all over again! </strong></h3><br><br>

<p>Enter constant relapses, and ‘ALLERGIES’ to cats, dogs, horses, pollen, dust etc. </p><br><br><p>Being ‘allergic’ to certain smells is an example of these reminders. Let’s say it was spring when you experienced a situation that ‘sucked’ such as moving schools as a kid. </p><br><br>
<p>The smells of spring time, like cut grass and pollen would be one of these reminders that cause your symptoms to start again. </p>

<h2 class='padded center'>Finding the FIRST biological conflict is also the first step in resolving sinus issues and allergies once and for all.  </h2><br>

<h2 class='padded center'><strong>HOW TO HEAL YOURSELF USING THE SAME <span class='underline'>3 STEP PROCESS</span>  I USE WITH CLIENTS:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CREATE AWARENESS:</strong> The first step to resolving sinus issues and allergies is to understand the <span class='underline'>precise unexpected biological conflict</span>  that caused the issues in th first place. <a href="https://learninggnm.com"target="_blank">German New Medicine</a> is the framework I used to help you find the specific cause of your problem. </li><br><br>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT:</strong> Once you have created conscious awareness around exactly what started your sinus issues and the 'scent conflict', if that situation is unresolved, the easiest way to heal and move past it is to remove yourself from the situation/person. Plus, become consciously aware of all of the TRIGGERS that you have around the original event. Becoming aware of these unconscious reminders help the symptoms disappear. Or... </li><br><br>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE:</strong>  When you can not remove yourself from an ongoing situation, the best strategy is changing your perspective on the situation. This often neutralises the “emotional charge” on specific events and allows your body to heal. Specific coaching strategies are AMAZING at helping you release these 'emotionally charged' and create a higher more empowered perspective. </li><br><br><br>
  <h3>BONUS TIPS FOR SINUS ISSUES: </h3>
  <li class='lists'>Journal about events where you feel like a situation really 'sucks' or about a predator in your environment (work, school, neighbour etc)</li>
  <li class='lists'>Notice when you FEEL uneasy, weary, worried, annoyed or triggered, there will be a theme that will lead you closer to the original conflict.  </li>
  <li class='lists'>Learn some GNM basics. This will help you understand your body and the conflicts that cause sinus issues. </li>
  <li class='lists'>Practice mediation to FEEL more at ease.  </li>
  <li class='lists'>Know that cats, dogs, pollen, dust etc are NOT the cause of your symptoms but just a trigger. They are safe! </li>
