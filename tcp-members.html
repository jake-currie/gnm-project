  </div>

  <div class="col-9_md-12 left padded-1">
    <p>Your body is absolutely amazing. </p>
    <p><strong>At any given moment, you have to ability to completely heal yourself.</strong></p>
    <p>You are probably familiar with the concept that disease starts energetically and emotionally before it manifests physically. You would not be reading this otherwise. </p>
    <p>It goes without saying, that...</p>
    <h2>"If you heal yourself on the inside, <em>you will heal on the outside."</em> </h2>
    <p>The problem is, people often start going on a wild goose chase, figuring out what they need to heal on the inside. </p>
    <p>- Is it my relationship with my dad? </p>
    <p>- Maybe it is because my mother was never there for me? </p>
    <p>- Is it because I have a hard time fitting in? </p>
    <!-- <p>- Or that injury when I was a teenage is still haunting me </p> -->
    <h4>Yes, maybe.  </h4>
    <p>I see people get so caught up in their past trying to heal emotionally. It ends up leaving people more conflicted than when they started. </p>
    <p>Often worse physically. Drained emotionally. </p>
    <h4>It is time you cut to the chase. </h4>
    <h2 class='grey'> I help you find and resolve the EXACT emotional conflict that has been causing problems in your physical body.</h2>
    <h4>This allows you to heal quickly and effectively from the inside out. </h4>


    <!-- <p><strong>At any given moment, you have to ability to completely heal yourself.</strong>  </p>
<p>Mastering your mind-body connection allows your brain and body to shift into healing and repair. </p>
<p>You just need to know </p>
<p><strong>And most importantly know how to overcome limitations in your thinking.  </strong></p>
<p>Understanding your mind is crucial, and understanding how your mind interacts with your body is the key. </p><br>
<h2 class='center'><em>"Your body follows your mind."</em></h2><br>
<p>By understanding how your body responds to your mind and inner conflicts, you can direct yourself to your most important inner healing. </p>
<p>All of sudden, you can EFFORTLESSLY shift the areas that have been blindspots, unconscious blocks holding you back from healing and growth. </p><br><br><br><br>

<!-- WHAT IS GNM?  -->
<section class='grid-centered padded light-bg mobile-padded'>
  <div class="col-8_sm-12">
    <h1 data-aos="fade-right">WHAT IS GNM?</h1><br>
    <p><em>"German New Medicine (GNM) is the science of how specific unexpected <em>biological conflicts</em> create physical adaptations in the body to help the organism cope with the stressful environment." </em></p><br>
    <p>Sounds complex, right? But it is actually very simple. </p>
    <p>To explain, think of an antelope... </p>
    <p>Let's call him, Anthony. </p>
    <p>Now Anthony the antelope is going for a drink at his usual watering hole, when...BAM!!!</p>
    <p><strong>NO WATER.</strong></p>
    <p>This is an <em>unexpected biological conflict</em> that potentially threatens his existance. </p>
    <p>As a result of this stressful environment, his little antelope kidneys start to adapt.</p><br>
    <h3><em>Modern medicine would call these adaptations a DISEASE.</em></h3><br>
    <p>A GNM practitioner <em>KNOWS</em> this "disease" is actually a smart adaptation by the body to help Anthony conserve water.</p>
    <p><strong>The changes are helping him survive and cope.</strong> </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Your body is no different to Anthony's. </h2><br>
    <br>
    <p> The stressful events that causes these diseases and changes, can be life or death, like Anthony not having any water. </p>
    <p>But more often, your life events are not life or death, <em>but your brain intepretes them as so. </em> </p><br>
    <h4>Some common and simple emotional biological conflicts that cause pain and disease: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Shoulder pain from feeling guitly about missing your kids soccer game </li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Digestive issues from hostile work environment</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Back pain after not getting the raise you were expecting</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> A skin rash that won't shift since a divorce</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> Chronic knee pain from feeling slow on the tennis court</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> A flu after Christmas with the inlaws </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Normal human stuff. </h2><br>
    <p>Finding the <em>specific unexpected emotional conflict</em> that is causing your problems, is like putting water back in Anthony's watering hole. </p>
    <p>All of a sudden, your body no longer needs to adapt and create pain and disease. </p>
    <p>It can start healing. <em>INSTANTLY.</em></p>
    <h4><em>German New Medicine is the road map, showing me exactly where your mind and psyche needs to heal.</em> </h4>

    <h1 class="uppercase">Meet Dr Jake Currie</h1><br>
    <p class='smaller'>As a chiropractor, I was naturally drawn to helping people heal. </p>
    <p class='smaller'>The more I practiced, the more I began to reailse peoples physical pain and problems were not physical at all, but emotionally based. </p>
    <p class='smaller'><em>The real adversary is poor thinking, and stuck beliefs. I noticed, as soon as people started to think in a more empowered way, they began to truly heal. Not just emotionally, but PHYSICALLY. </em> </p>
    <p class='smaller'>I started intensly studying German New Medicine (GNM) the work of Dr Hamer 6 years ago. This was a game changer. </p>
    <p class='smaller'> Finally I had a framework to understand the mind-body connection, and to understand what I had seen in practice. </p>
    <p class='smaller'><em>I quickly realised that the most important work for healing and growth happened on the inside.</em> </p>
    <p class='smaller'>I'm still in the world of healing, just in a different way. Instead of removing physical blockages from the body, I am helping people remove blockages from their mind. </p>
    <p class='smaller'>The work of GNM not only helps people heal and grow, it also helps remove the fear from disease and symptoms. </p>
    <p class='smaller'>For many, knowing the principals of GNM allows them to feel in control of their own health. </p>
    <p><strong>Today I specialise in physical pain and chronic illnesses, helping people to see a physical shift in the symptoms in literally minutes. </strong> </p>

      <h2> HOW DOES GNM WORK AS A THERAPY?</h2>
      <p>There are 3 key componets to help you heal with GNM. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded center">
      <img src="/images/awareness.jpg" class='margin-bottom lazyload' alt="" data-aos="fade-right">
      <h4>CREATE AWARENESS</h4>
      <p class='smaller left'>The first step to resolving physical symptoms and problems is to become aware of the EXACT emotional conflicts that created the changes. The study of GNM is like a roadmap, showing me exactly what kind of conflicts are creating your specific problems. I use your history and body as my guide. </p>
    </div>


    <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded center">
      <img src="/images/breaking.jpg" class='margin-bottom lazyload' alt="" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h4>BREAK ASSOCIATIONS</h4>
      <p class='smaller left'>With any unexpected emotional 'shock' the subconscious mind takes a mental snapshot of everything you see, hear, taste, feel and smell to protect you from future encounters. Each time your subsconscious is reminded about the inital conflict you reactivate the disease or problem. Constant reactivation of old conflicts is why people have problems that continue to come back again and again, never truly resolving. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-4_sm-12 padded center">
      <img src="/images/perspective.jpg" class='margin-bottom lazyload' alt="" data-aos="fade-in">
      <h4>SHIFT PERSPECTIVE</h4>
      <p class='smaller left'>Because of the specific nature of biological conflicts and the GNM understanding, the inner healing work is laser focused. I will help coach you to start to see the conflict in a completely new light, taking the emotional 'charge' away so you can feel peaceful again and start healing from the inside out. </p>

    <h2>Phoebe Kuhn</h2>
    <p><em>Communication and Content Specialist</em></p><br>

    <h4>Jake is one of those rare and special people that truly “gets it”. I’ve never worked with anyone that has such a profound, intimate and full rounded knowledge of the mind-body connection.</h4><br><br>
    <p>I have spent over three years studying human behaviour, the quantum field and Psychosomatics with some of the best teachers and coaches in the world but I was only able to get so far. It has only been since working with Jake that I feel I now
      have the real answers that lie underneath ANY physiological symptoms. </p>
    <p> I’ve had three 1:1 sessions with Jake and every single one of them was more profound and awe inspiring than the last. I was highly allergic to cats since I was a child. Every time a cat would come near me my eyes and face would swell up, turn
      red and itch for several days afterward.</p>
    <p> Having recently moved to Bali, I was surrounded by stray animals and became concerned about my allergies. In just fifteen minutes using GNM Jake completely alleviated me of my allergy. I have since lived in a house with TWO cats and am completely symptom free!</p>
    <p>The second time I called him was to discuss a sharp pain in my left shoulder. I initially thought it was from tearing a muscle during a workout but my personal trainer confirmed that we didn’t train my shoulder that day so I KNEW it had to be what Jake taught me was the symptom of an “emotional conflict”.</p>

    <details>

      <summary style='font-size: 1.2rem; font-family:open sans;'>READ MORE</summary><br>
      <p> The pain was an excruciating 9/10. In the 24 hours prior to our call I had tried two different remedial therapists and nothing helped. Within fifteen minutes of speaking to Jake, the pain had lessened to a 2/10! The emotional/mental reasons behind the pain also made so much sense and just having the awareness of the conflict not only helped to speed up the healing process but also helped me to forgive myself for a lot of guilt I was feeling around personal decisions I had made in my relationships.</p>
      <p>The night after our call I was able to rest easy, both in my body and also having clarity and peace in my mind. </p>
      <p>Our last call was the most interesting one of all. He encouraged me to rewrite a story I was telling myself about a breakup that was causing me insomnia and a lack of focus in my business for about two weeks. That evening I had one of the most heart opening experiences I had in a long time. Through looking at the breakup in a completely new light, I broke THROUGH the discomfort and pain I was feeling in my heart and moved to a place of deep appreciation for both that person and myself. I saw how everything had to happen exactly the way that it did, so that I could move to the next phase of my life with grace. That everything really was happening FOR me and not to me. That there was a deeper meaning behind these events. </p>
      <p>Since that day I have been feeling nothing but grateful for who I am and where I’m going. Working with Jake and GNM has been one of the most transformational experiences of my life. Thank you so much Jake. </p>

    <p><em>Self Love and Relationship Coach</em></p><br>
    <p>Over the last 6 months I’ve been working with Jake and every session has been absolutely life changing. Being a life coach myself I’m pretty familiar with a myriad of techniques and methodologies to identify & overcome limiting beliefs and the
      way they show up in the physical body but have never experienced this depth of accuracy in diagnose and immediate transformation as Jake supported me to achieve.</p>
    <p>The first time we had a session I managed to get rid of chronic pain on my shoulder that I’ve experienced for over 3 years. The pain would come and go and it was limiting my quality of life. 15’ into the session the pain was almost gone and
      even better: I got a clear understanding of where it was coming from which in turn caused a profound transformation on the way I was addressing a specific challenge in my intimate relationships.</p>
    <p>I’d totally recommend you to work with Jake. I literally call him the wizard and I recommend it to all my friends who have also seen outstanding results.</p>
