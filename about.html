  <h2 class='padded-bottom'> Heal from the <strong><em>inside out</em></strong> </h2>
  <p> My passion is helping people heal naturally, and live fearlessly by being connected to themselves.  </p>
  <p> German New Medicine has given me the tools to change my own health from the inside, let go of unconscious patterns holding me back and most importantly, have the ability to do deep inner healing work myself. </p>
<p><em>This work has given me the framework to help people heal chronic physical injuries and conditions when modern medicine has failed.</em> </p>
  <p> From people with 'unexplained symptoms' or problems that simply go away, the body makes no mistakes, only adaptations. <br><br> <strong>Nothing excites me more than seeing people make the connections between their symptoms and the emotional conflicts which created it.</strong></p>
  <h2>I want to show you what you are capable of. </h2>

    <h2>The old version of me</h2>
    <p>I was constantly injured growing up. Playing competitive sport, there was not a season where I didn't have at least a few weeks off because of some 'mystery injury.'</p>
    <p>I mean I understood when I got an injury from a big collision in football, but most of my injuries showed up out of the blue for no reason. </p><br>
    <h4 class='center'>For years, I chased physical treatments, and diets to try and allivate my physical pain. Nothing ever lasted long.  </h4>

    <h2>Where it all began </h2><br>
    <h4>My life changed the day I discovered German New Medicine (GNM), which I think of as the precise 'roadmap' to mind-body healing.</h4>
  <p> My GNM story started at a health and wellness expo in Caloundra, Australia. I was there giving a presentation on running technique and talking to people about chiropractic. During the expo I watched a presentation by a man named Dr. Alvin De Leon, a fellow chiropractor from Canada. He spoke about GNM and the Five Biological Laws. <br><br><span class='underline'>His presentation resonated with something deep inside of me, a deep knowing, a truth.</span><br><br>  Later after the presentation, I went up and spoke to Dr. Alvin  and William Hughes. <br> <br> <strong>It was this conversation with Will that changed my life.</strong> <br><br> I had a groin strain from CrossFit that was completely debilitating. It was yet another injury that came on seemingly for no reason.<br><br> <em>Despite my best rehabilitation efforts I had not been able to train for around 5 months. Nothing I did seemed to help, I did everything right but this injury just wouldn't budge.</em> <br><br>

    - Anti-inflammation diets <br>
    - Ice Baths <br>
    - Acupuncture <br>
    - Adjustments <br>
    - Fasting <br>
    - Stretching <br>
    - Rehabilitation Exercises <br>
    - Massage <br></p>

    <h4>NOTHING. </h4>

  <p> <br>I asked William if stress can cause pain and muscle tears. He responded with a calm but definitive, yes. In the next 5 minutes of conversation Will took my pain from a 7/10 (squeezing my legs together) down to a 1/10, just by asking me some specific questions. Sure enough, I was hanging on to a particular emotional conflict. My awareness around this conflict shifted the pain immediately. I left the conversation completely dumbfounded! <br><br><h2>How did my body heal <span class='underline'>instantly</span> just from becoming aware of something I was stressed about?!</h2> <br><br><p>That conversation was in May 2014, ever since then I have been studying and learning everything I can about GNM from Will, my mentor, Alvin, Caroline and the Learning GNM resources. As a chiropractor every patient I saw after this initial interaction I looked at through GNM eyes. <br><br></p>
  <h3>What is the root cause of this persons problem? Where emotionally did this start? </h3><p>This knowledge was a blessing but also a curse. It became increasingly difficult to maintain the status-quo of being a chiropractor. Sure, I was having amazing results with patients, but I wanted to work help people entirely with GNM, something that is difficult in a busy chiropractic office. I decided to sell the practice and take some time away. <br><br>18 months after transitioning away from chiropractic practice, I am now practicing German New Medicine full-time. Consulting clients online, helping them make the connection between their physical symptoms and the emotional cause.  </p>
