    <p> My passion is helping people heal naturally, and living in awe of the power of the human body and mind. </p>
    <p> German New Medicine has given me the tools to help people take their health to the next level. From people with 'unexplained symptoms' or problems that simply go away, the body makes no mistakes, only adaptations. <br><br> <strong>Nothing excites me more than seeing people make the connections between their symptoms and the emotional conflicts which created it.</strong></p> <br><br>

  <h2 class='padded-1'> About Me </h2>
    <p><strong> I understand you. </strong></p>
    <p>Living with unexplained pain, or symptoms that simply won't go away is what started me on my GNM journey. </p>
    <p> I had grown my Chiropractic practice in Noosa from scratch to capacity within a year, the beauty of that was working with lots of people. More and more I noticed that peoples physical symptoms were not physical at all. I was frustrated with why some patients got great results and some patients never seemed to get better, despite all my best efforts. </p>
    <p> <strong>The day I found GNM Everything changed. </strong></p>
    <p>I now was able to see the emotional causes of people problems, and help them move through it effortlessly. </p>

    <h2> Where it all began </h2>
    <p> I was drawn to chiropractic for its philosophy; <strong> the body heals from the inside out.</strong> Chiropractic at its core recognises that the body has an amazing ability to heal, it works with the body to help these inborn healing abilities. I started university feeling like I was about to change the world, and help people heal naturally! However, my time at  university started to change my perspective of this. Chiropractic was feeling the pressure to become more 'mainstream' in an attempt to seek approval from the scientific medical community. In doing so, chiropractic began to shy away from these natural laws that it was founded on, what I was originally drawn to, in doing so making us graduates more like physiotherapists.  <br><br> I began to feel upset with where I felt the profession was going.  <br><br> My GNM story started at a health and wellness expo in Caloundra. I was there giving a presentation on running technique and talking to people about chiropractic. During the expo I watched a presentation by a man named Dr. Alvin De Leon, a fellow chiropractor from Canada. He spoke about GNM and the Five Biological Laws. His presentation resonated with something deep inside of me, a deep knowing, a truth.  Later after the presentation, I went up and spoke to Dr. Alvin  and William Hughes. <br> <br> <strong>It was this conversation with Will that changed my life.</strong> <br><br> I had a groin strain from CrossFit that was completely debilitating, despite my best rehabilitation efforts I had not been able to train for around 5 months. Nothing I did seemed to help, I did everything right but this injury just wouldn't budge. I asked Will if GNM can help with pain and muscle tears. He responded with a calm but definitive, yes. In the next 5 minutes of conversation Will took my pain from a 7/10 (squeezing my legs together) down to a 1/10, just by asking me some specific questions. Sure enough, I was hanging on to a particular emotional conflict. My awareness around this conflict shifted the pain immediately. I left the conversation completely dumbfounded! <br><br>How can something like that change instantly just from being aware of something I was stressed about?! <br><br>That conversation was in May 2014, ever since then I have been studying and learning everything I can about GNM from Will, my mentor, Alvin, Caroline and the Learning GNM resources. As a chiropractor every patient I saw after this initial interaction I looked at from a GNM perspective. <br><br>This knowledge was a blessing but also a curse. It became increasingly difficult to maintain the status-quo of being a chiropractor. Sure, I was having amazing results with patients, but I wanted to work help people entirely with GNM, something that is difficult in a busy chiropractic office. I decided to sell the practice and take some time away. <br><br>A year and a half later, I found my happy medium working with people again and helping them with GNM. I am so grateful for the opportunity to help people in this way! </p>
