patient-description_html: 28 year old right handed male with right sided wrist pain, approximately 2 years in duration. The pain is a constant dull ache and interferes with many daily activities of the client.
date_html: 15/6/2019
subjective-complaint_html: The client presented with right sided wrist pain 2 years in duration. He indicates that the pain is a nearly constant dull ache which is worse with any extension movement of the wrist such as surfing (when pushing up), push up exercises, and carrying/holding heavy camera gear.
objective-findings_html: Wrist extension was decreased on the right side and limited due to pain. Other orthopaedic tests were unremarkable.
calibration_html: Extensions of the wrist elicited a 5/10 pain level. Pain, tenderness and swelling were noted upon palpation. Palpation of the right wrist extensor tendons over the carpal bones produced a further 6/10 pain level.
explanation_html: A medium self-devaluation conflict relating to ‘failure of a manual task’ of the extensor tendons of the wrist in relation to “partner”. The client is currently in a ‘hanging healing’, it is important to bring awareness to the original conflict as well as identify and negate any tracks.
organs_html: Muscles and tendons of the right knee wrist; Embryonic Germ Layer - new mesoderm Brain Control Center - Cerebral medulla.
awareness_html: Upon questioning, the client revealed that he experienced a conflict 2 years previously. He was performing landscaping work and had quoted a job. Upon commencing the job he realised the scope of work was far larger than he initially expected. The client presented this information to the owner of the property who became upset that the job would cost more than she initially expected. She said that it was his fault that the work had blown out and that he had quoted her a fixed price (his DHS). <br><br> The client was forced to finish the extra work, unpaid and by himself over the course of the following 3 weeks. Much of the work he completed during this time he was on hands and knees with his wrist in a flexed position. Upon nearing completion of the work the client went into healing (Phase A) as he was aware that the job would come to completion.
associations_html: The physical pain in the wrist became a track for this program, each time the client experienced pain he thought there was something wrong with his wrist.
perspective_html:  Taking the German New Perspective of knee pain the client was able to see his symptoms in a new light. After seeing the immediate improve
results_html: With new awareness to the original conflict the client experienced an immediate reduction in pain upon palpation and also wrist extension. He was able to recognise that the incident happened a long time ago and he no longer needed to worry about it. A follow up was made the next day and the client reported that he had not had any wrist pain since discussing the matter. A further follow up 2 weeks later revealed the client had not experienced any wrist pain since our original discussion.
