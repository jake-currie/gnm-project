patient-description_html: 41 year old right handed male with right sided knee pain. Physically fit other than the symptoms he is experiencing.
date_html: 18/6/2019
subjective-complaint_html: The client presented with right sided knee pain 2/10 in intensity. The client revealed that he had an injury sometime previously (approximately 9 months) but the knee pain was not progressing and healing despite a comprehensive rehabilitation program.
objective-findings_html: With testing the client showed minimal reductions in flexion and extension. All muscle tests around the knee joint were unremarkable. All knee orthopaedic tests including; Mcmurray's, A-P draw, P-A draw and stability tests were negative.
calibration_html: The client was asked to perform a passive movement that elicited the discomfort he was experiencing. In this instance, it was performing a squat position. This position reproduced the pain (2/10)  and he also felt ‘tightness’ sensation in the anterior aspect of his knee.
explaination_html: A medium self-devaluation conflict affecting the right knee ‘there is something wrong with my knee’. The client is currently in a ‘hanging healing’, it is important to bring awareness to the original conflict as well as identify and remove any tracks.
organs_html: Muscles of the right knee joint Embryonic Germ Layer - new mesoderm Brain Control Center - Cerebral medulla.
awareness_html: The client explained a series of events which took place 1 year previously. While surfing the client had an accident where the board hit the medial aspect of his knee with some force. After the initial pain subsided he continued surfing that day with minimal disruption. <br> <br> The following day he noticed that he was in pain after the accident. Following the injury, each time we went surfing he noticed that the pain would return post surf walking out of the water on the sand. This prompted him to get some further investigation as to the cause of the knee pain. <br> <br>Getting an MRI revealed a partial tear of the ACL, damage to the meniscus and a strain of the medial collateral ligament <strong> (His DHS)</strong>. He reported this scan proved to be quite a shock, as he initially did not think the injury was as bad as the scan suggested. His thoughts were confirmed when he showed the scans to a medical friend who told him his knee was ‘screwed’. <br> <br> From this he determined that the only way to have a well functioning knee again would be to have it surgically repaired. However, 3 separate medicos suggested he resolve the problem with a conservative approach. Although he progressed well through rehab and established good stability and strength within the knee he ‘never trusted it’ as he knew underneath there were tears and ruptures.<br> <br> Since the diagnosis the patient had a self imposed ban on surfing to prevent further damage “I can not surf”. This feeling of ‘not being able to surf’ in combination with ‘there is something wrong with my knee’ proved to be a challenging situation to seeing a full resolution. <br> <br>Any form of pain experienced in the knee plus the obsessive desire to rehabilitate his knee proved to be a strong track to reaffirm the conflict of there is ‘something wrong with my knee’.
associations_html: Any form of pain experienced in the knee plus the obsessive desire to rehabilitate his knee in order to 'fix it' proved to be a strong track to reaffirm the conflict of there is ‘something wrong with my knee’.
perspective_html:  Taking the German New Perspective of knee pain the client was able to see his symptoms in a new light. He also told of his new perspective on his knee pain, knowing that his thoughts around having ‘something wrong with his knee’ were actually contributing to his delayed healing. His new perspective was a welcome relief as he knew that his knee was ok and in fact healing well.
results_html: With new awareness and understanding of his symptoms and the original conflict, the client noticed an immediate improvement in pain levels and range of motion (0/10). The ‘tightness’ the patient initially experienced has gone. After discussing the conflict the patient noticed ‘clicking’ in his knee as he performed the calibration squat test. Something that was unusual for him. The patient also needed to urinate immediately after the session. <br><br> A follow up one week later revealed the client was doing very well, he had minimal pain since our session and if he did, he was not worried about it. He was also excited to reveal that he had got back in the water and was surfing again. Surfing for the first time was a great relief for him.
