awareness_html: The client reported her symptoms started the day that she arrived to Bali on the first day of her vacation, she put it down to sitting on the plane. Upon questioning the patient revealed she had experienced an unexpected shock in relation to her work a week prior. In her position at work, she was told by her supervisor on numerous occasions how much they valued her and how important she is to the company but unfortunately they could not offer her a permanent position at the firm, as their budget would not allow for such a promotion. However, the company later hired two new employees which were taking her position (Her DHS). The client admitted it felt like a massive betrayal to be told they could not afford to give her a permanent position and then turn around and offer the position to two new people.  For her it was also a matter of not getting enough support from her supervisor who was responsible for the hiring of new employees. She mentioned that she was indeed worried about being able to support herself financially having not received a permanent position and needing to stay in the work environment despite wanting to move on. Once the client connected her emotional conflict to her physical symptoms she noticed an immediate shift in the pain levels, moving from a 5/10 with flexion to a 1/10.

associations_html: The following day, the client reported that she felt great and was not in any more pain. However, two days later, the client got in contact with me explaining that she had been experiencing significant amounts of pain again, particularly in the middle of her back. She reported levels of 8/10 at their worse, the client reported a 4/10 pain level which had subsided after taking codeine. I gently reminded her of our discussion two days previously and questioned her as to what had reminder her of the original conflict. The client reported that day she received an email from her supervisor informing her of all the duties she needed to perform when she returned home from her Bali vacation (Her Track). She reported that reading this email made her realise she would have to return home and front up to the situation, and return to work in an environment she no longer wanted to be in, but needed to be for finances (support conflict) the thought of this brought her considerable stress and brought the original conflict to the forefront.

results_html: After our first session with new awareness and understanding of her DHS and the associated healing symptoms the client noticed immediate improvements. In our subsequent consultation the client was asked to identify her tracks and become aware of any tracks or triggers if they occurred in the future. Above all the client was encouraged to look at the big picture and change her perspective surrounding the ‘betrayal and lack of support’. This was easy for her, as she felt like she was destined for bigger and better things in her line of work. In our second phone consultation the client's pain levels went from a 4/10 to 0. A follow up later that week revealed she had not had any pain return.
