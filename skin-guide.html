      <h2 class='uppercase'><strong>the mind body connection</strong></h2>
<p class='underline'>Epigenetics is now showing us what ancients have known forever. </p><br>
<h2>Skin conditions start first in your mind. </h2><br><br>
<p>The study of <a href="https:/learninggnm.com" target="_blank">German New Medicine</a> is now bridging the gap between modern science and ancient wisdom. </p><br>
<p>Based on thousands of case studies and brain scans, Dr Ryke Geerd Hamer discovered that most “dis-eases”, pain, skin-issues, and illness start from <strong>unexpected biological conflicts.</strong> </p><br><br>
<p>The <strong>VERY INSTANT</strong> you experience a biological conflict, or unexpected trauma, it impacts your psyche.</p><br><br>
<h3 class='padded center'> <strong>You feel it emotionally, often feeling distressed, isolated or simply caught off guard.</strong>  </h3>
<p><br>
Then your brain starts a cascade of physical changes in your body to help you cope with the <span class='underline'>stressful situation.</span> </p>
<p>Depending on the type of conflict you experienced, determines how your body responds and what symptoms will show up. </p>
<p>Skin conditions show up in <strong>VERY SPECIFIC</strong> areas depending on how conflicts were perceived by you. </p><br><br><br><br>
<h2 class='uppercase'><strong>The real cause of Skin Conditions:</strong></h2><br>
<p>There are 2 types of biological conflicts that are responsible for creating skin conditions. </p>
<p>The first is called a <strong class='underline'>‘seperation conflict’.</strong> </p><br>
<p>Missing physical contact after experiencing an unexpected separation from a loved one. Or the opposite, WANTING TO SEPARATE from someone or something. </p>
<p>These types of conflicts cause the cells on the outer layer of skin to PHYSICALLY ulcerate. The biological purpose of this is to ‘not feel the painful separation’. </p>
<li class="lists">Skin Rashes,</li>
<li class="lists">Eczema, </li>
<li class="lists">Dry Flakey Skin, </li>
<li class="lists">Red itchy swollen skin</li><br><br><br>
<p>The other type of conflict that causes skin conditions are <strong>‘attack conflicts’, ‘disfigurement conflicts’</strong> and <strong>‘soiled conflicts’</strong>. </p><br><br>
<p>These types of biological conflicts cause your skin to grow extra cells in order to form a physical barrier to the stressful environment, develop <em>“thick skin”.</em> </p><br>
<li class="lists">Acne,</li>
<li class="lists">Shingles, </li>
<li class="lists">'Abnormal' Skin Growths,</li>
<li class="lists">Hives</li><br><br><br>
<h2 class='uppercase '><strong>how unexpected conflicts cause Skin conditions:</strong></h2>
<h2 class='center'>This may sound woo-woo, but it is <span class='underline'>science.</span> </h2>
<p>It is highly specific, highly accurate, based on thousands of real life case studies and brain scans. GNM is actually now being taught in medical universities in Nicaragua. </p> <br><br><br>
<p>In the instance of the first type of conflict, the <strong>SEPARATION CONFLICT</strong>, when you're stressed about the unexpected conflict, your skin will ulcerate so you <em>‘can’t FEEL the painful separation’</em>.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2 class='padded center'><em>NOT FEELING THE PAINFUL SEPARATION IS YOUR BODIES WAY OF <span class='underline'>HELPING</span> YOU COPE WITH THE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.</em> </h2><br><br>
<p>When you are ‘stressed’ about this type of conflict, your skin typically looks ok. You might notice some dry skin, or perhaps some discolouration like a whitening. </p><br><br>
<h2><strong>THE RASH STARTS WHEN THE CONFLICT RESOLVES</strong></h2><br><br>
<p>The itch, inflammation, redness, and swelling of the skin are all parts of the <em>healing process. </em></p><br><br>
<p>But this is typically when people think their skin  <span class='underline'>‘has flared up’</span>.</p><br><br>
<p>Normally you will have a rash for a few days maybe. Then the body will return to balance. </p><br><br>

<h2><strong>BUT WHY DO I HAVE CHRONIC SKIN CONDITIONS THAT WON'T GO AWAY?</strong></h2><br>
<p class='underline'>Because you are <strong>unaware</strong> of what unexpected conflict started the skin changes in the first place.</p><br> <br>
<p>Your subconscious mind will take note of everything you heard, smelt, tasted, TOUCHED, saw, and felt. </p><br><br>
<p>Any time you encounter one of these reminders, your body will have the same stress response. Your brain does this to protect your from danger.</p><br><br>
<h2 class='padded center'>UNCONSCIOUSLY you are TRIGGERED</h2>
<p><strong>And BOOM your symptoms will come back!</strong></p>
<h3 class='underline'>Constant relapses, and chronic skin issues. </h3><br><br>
<p>Or the unexpected conflict is only partly resolved. Eg. You go through a divorce, but you still see your Ex on a regular basis. </p><br><br>
<p>The purpose of these physical changes is to <span class='underline'>HELP YOU</span>. Help your skin, not feel the painful separation. </p><br><br>
<p>Or in the instance of attack conflicts, the added skin growth (acne, etc) helps you create a physical barrier between you and the environment responsible for the attack. </p><br><br>
<h3>Giving you 'THICK SKIN'</h3><br><br>
<h2 class='padded center'>Nature does not make mistakes. There is ALWAYS a meaningful purpose to your symptoms.</h2><br><br>

<h2 class='padded center'><strong>HOW TO HEAL YOURSELF USING THE SAME <span class='underline'>3 STEP PROCESS</span>  I USE WITH CLIENTS:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CREATE AWARENESS:</strong> The first step to skin conditions is to understand the <span class='underline'>precise unexpected biological conflict</span>  that caused the changes to start. Depending on the type of skin condition you are dealing with and where it shows up on your body correlates with VERY SPECIFIC biological (emotional) conflicts. <a href="https://learninggnm.com"target="_blank">German New Medicine</a> is the framework I used to help you find the specific cause of your skin conditions. </li><br><br>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT:</strong> Once you have created conscious awareness around exactly what started your skin conditions, if that situation is unresolved, the easiest way to heal and move past it is to remove yourself from the situation. Plus, become conscious aware of all of the TRIGGERS that you have around the original event. Becoming aware of these unconscious reminders helps the symptoms disappear.  Or... </li><br><br>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE:</strong>  When you can not remove yourself from an ongoing situation, the best strategy is changing your perspective on the situation. This often neutralises the “emotional charge” on specific events and allows your body to heal. Specific coaching strategies are AMAZING at helping you release these 'emotionally charged' and create a higher more empowered perspective.  </li><br><br><br>
  <h3>BONUS SKIN TIPS: </h3>
  <li class='lists'>Look at events where you experienced unexpected separations from family etc.</li>
  <li class='lists'>Look at events where you felt attacked, something disgusting touched your skin, or there was something wrong with your skin. </li>
  <li class='lists'>Learn some GNM basics. This will help you understand your body and the conflicts that cause skin conditions. </li>
  <li class='lists'>Journal about where you feel separated, want to separate from someone or something, and where you have felt attacked</li>
  <li class='lists'>Rewrite your story. Find the events that have been challenging for you and write a more empowered story (use your imagination).</li>
  <!-- <p>This can be done through journaling, talking, but most effectively, coaching. The best way I can describe how I help people shift there perspective on ‘charged’ events is I am not in the box. You are in the box trying to get out, and you have been in there for a while. I am not in the same box, so I can easily see the way out for you, then I guide you to the escape. </p>
  <p>The reason this is important, is because your subconscious mind takes a mental note of what was going on around the time of the unexpected conflict. Every time you are unconsciously reminded of the conflict, pain will ‘flare up’.
</p>
<p>For example, I had a client who had a bad breakup, he would get pain every day. I asked, “what reminds you of her and the break up EVERYDAY?” </p>
<p>He told me he had to drive past her house on the way to work.</p>
<p>EASY. Change the route you take to work I advised. This was enough to shift his daily pain as he was not being reminded of the bad breakup.</p> -->
