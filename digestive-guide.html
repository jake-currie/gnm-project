<h2><strong>A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON DIGESTIVE ISSUES</strong>
</h2>
<p><span class='underline'>Epigenetics is now showing us what ancients have known forever.</span>  </p><br>
<p><em><strong>Digestive issues, and conditions start first in your mind, then show up on your body.</strong></em> </p>
<p>The study of <a href="https://learninggnm.com"target="_blank">German New Medicine</a> is now bridging the gap between modern science and ancient wisdom.  </p><br>
<p>Based on thousands of case studies and brain scans, Dr Ryke Geerd Hamer discovered that most “dis-eases”, pain, and illness start from <strong>unexpected biological conflicts.</strong> </p><br><br>

<p>The moment you experience a biological conflict, it impacts your psyche.</p><br><br>

<h2 class='center bold'>You feel it emotionally, often feeling distressed, angry, isolated, disappointed,  or simply caught off guard.  </h2><br><br>

<p>Then your brain starts a cascade of physical changes in your body to <span class='underline'>help you cope</span> with the stressful situation. </p><br>

<p>Depending on the type of conflict you experienced determines how your body responds and what symptoms will show up. </p><br>

<p>Digestive issues show us in <strong>VERY SPECIFIC</strong> ways based on how conflicts were perceived by you. </p><br><br><br><br>

<h2><strong>THE REAL CAUSE OF DIGESTIVE ISSUES</strong></h2><br>
  <p>One of the types of biological conflicts that is responsible for creating digestive issues is known as an <strong>‘Indigestible Morsel Conflict’.</strong> </p><br>

  <p>Experiencing an event where something was <strong>‘hard to digest’</strong>. This type of conflict often presents as an indigestible <strong>ANGER</strong> conflict. </p><br><br>

  <p>Feeling an <span class='underline'>unresolved anger</span> towards a particular person in your life, or situational anger, such as being angry about something that is happening in your work/school life. </p><br><br>

  <h3 class='center padded'>If you find yourself regularly angry towards certain people in your life, it is likely that this is linked with any digestive issues/food intolerances you are experiencing. </h3><br><br>
  <h2><strong>HOW DOES THIS WORK?</strong></h2><br>

  <p> This type of conflict causes the cells of the intestinal wall to proliferate, growing more cells.</P> <br>
     <h2 class='center padded'>The biological purpose of this change is to be able to better <span class='underline'>absorb the ‘indigestible morsel’</span> or to be able to ‘digest the morsal’. </h2><br>
<br>
  <p>The other way this indigestible morsel conflict can be perceived is <strong>‘not being ABLE to digest the morsel (food)’</strong>. Animals are a good example of a literal conflict, ‘not being able to digest food’ (example: a lion missing out on eating a kill they were expecting). </p><br><br>

  <h4>We humans experience indigestible morsel conflicts more figuratively.</h4><br><br>

  <p>For example, the morsel, or (‘food’) could be a promotion, a new job, a house, a car, a big deal. If we are expecting a big promotion for example and then it falls through, that would likely create this change. </p><br><br>

  <p>Other examples of this type of conflict may be an <strong>‘ugly situation’</strong> such as a bad divorce, ugly betrayals, or nasty disputes over money/property/work etc. </p><br>

<h2 class='uppercase'><strong>The 'digestive trouble' starts when the conflict RESOLVES </strong></h2><br><br>
<p>
The abdominal cramping, the nausea, the diarrhea, the vomiting, the night sweats, are all a part of the body's natural  <em>healing process.</em> </p><br><br>
<p>Normally you will have these symptoms for 24 hours, or a few days (depending on how intense the conflict was). Then once the body has healed, the body will return to balance. No more symptoms!  </p><br><br>
<p>The symptoms you are experiencing during this time is the body getting rid of all the extra cells in the intestine.  </p><br><br>
<p>After all, you don’t need help digesting the ‘morsel’ anymore. </p><br><br>
<h2 class='center'>Nature does not make mistakes. There is ALWAYS a meaningful purpose to your symptoms.</h2><br><br><br>

<h2 class='uppercase'><strong>But why are my digestive issues chronic, or constant relapses?  </strong></h2><br><br>
<p><span class='underline'>Because you are unaware of what unexpected conflict started the digestive issues in the first place.</span>  </p><br><br>
<p>As a result, you will <strong>UNCONSCIOUSLY</strong> be <strong>TRIGGERED</strong> each time you are reminded of what happened.  </p><br><br>
<p>Eg. You are pissed off at your ex husband for betraying you, and every time you see him, hear from him, or even THINK of him, you will be <strong>TRIGGERED UNCONSCIOUSLY.</strong>  </p><br><br>
<h3 class='underline'><strong>Your symptoms will start all over again!</strong> </h3><br><br>
<p>Enter constant relapses, and <strong>FOOD ALLERGIES.</strong></p><br><br>
<p>Being ‘allergic’ to certain foods is an example of these reminders. Let’s say you were eating pizza when you found out about his betrayal...Each time you eat pizza, or gluten, tomato, or dairy, your digestive system will go into overdrive helping you to ‘digest the morsel.’  </p><br>
<p>This is why most people who are allergic to say gluten, were completely fine with it for 20 years before. Then ‘out of the blue’ gluten started to ‘disagree’ with them. </p><br>
<h2 class='center padded'>Finding the first biological conflict is also the first step in resolving food allergies. The second is KNOWING those foods are ok for you. </h2>

<h2 class='padded center'><strong>HOW TO HEAL YOURSELF USING THE SAME <span class='underline'>3 STEP PROCESS</span>  I USE WITH CLIENTS:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CREATE AWARENESS:</strong> The first step to resolving digestive issues and food allergies is to understand the <span class='underline'>precise unexpected biological conflict</span>  that caused the digestive issues in the first place. <a href="https://learninggnm.com"target="_blank">German New Medicine</a> is the framework I used to help you find the specific cause of your pain. </li><br><br>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT:</strong> Once you have created conscious awareness around exactly what started your digestive issues, if that situation is unresolved, the easiest way to heal and move past it is to remove yourself from the situation. Plus, become consciously aware of all of the TRIGGERS that you have around the original event. Becoming aware of these unconscious reminders help the symptoms disappear. Or... </li><br><br>
  <li class='numbers'><strong>CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVE:</strong>  When you can not remove yourself from an ongoing situation, the best strategy is changing your perspective on the situation. This often neutralises the “emotional charge” on specific events and allows your body to heal. Specific coaching strategies are AMAZING at helping you release these 'emotionally charged' and create a higher more empowered perspective. </li><br><br><br>
  <h3>BONUS TIPS FOR DIGESTIVE ISSUES: </h3>
  <li class='lists'>Journal about events where you are still holding anger or resentment towards others,</li>
  <li class='lists'>Notice when you FEEL angry or triggered, there will be a theme that will lead you closer to the original conflict,  </li>
  <li class='lists'>Learn some GNM basics. This will help you understand your body and the conflicts that cause disgestive issues, </li>
  <li class='lists'>Practice forgiveness, </li>
  <li class='lists'>KNOW that foods that have caused you digestive issues in the past are SAFE for you to eat. </li>
